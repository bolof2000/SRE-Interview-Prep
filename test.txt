 want to count the number of times each word is found in the text file and am not sure what is wrong. I was also having trouble finding a way to include in the count the occurrences where the word is not capitalized as well

the script expects two command-line arguments: the name of an input file and a threshold (an integer)
The input file contains exactly one word per line, with no whitespace before or after the word. The script does not need to verify the contents of the input file.

The letter case of words in the input file does not matter for counting. For example, the script should count “the”, “The”, and “THE” as the same word.

After counting the words, the script prints a report (to a file, output.txt) that lists the words and their counts. Each word is printed only if its count is greater than or equal to the threshold given on the command line.
